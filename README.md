🚀 Rpn42: A RPN Calculator for mobile devices (Android, iOS) written in Unity and C#

It is currently in development. No current plan for public release.

🌟 Features

Cross-Platform: Primarily designed with Android in mind, with secondary support for iOS. But it also compiles for other targets such as WebAsm with limited support.

📚 Dependencies

This project relies on [MathLib](https://github.com/HexMerlin/MathLib), a mathematics library that powers all the math aspects of Rpn42. To explore [MathLib](https://github.com/HexMerlin/MathLib), visit its GitHub repository.

🔧 Installation

You need the complete Unity project to build and run Rpn42, unfortunately. Due to size constraints, the full project is not included in this repository. 

🎨 Design Philosophy

Rpn42 is designed with a focus on rational numbers, with both established and experimental mathematics.
